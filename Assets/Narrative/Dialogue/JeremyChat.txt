Jeremy: Hey there! How are you doing today? 
Eden: Hi! I’m doing good, how about you?
Jeremy: I’m doing alright! Just got home after doing some light reading at a cafe. I saw that you said you enjoy horror movies, do you have a favorite?
Eden: Oh yea I love horror films! I think my favorite currently is Midsommar. How about you - do you like horror movies?
Jeremy: Gotta love Ari Aster, he makes some good movies! And yes I love a good horror film, not sure if I could point out a favorite though there are just so many good ones. 
Eden: Oh yea I totally get that, my “favorite” changes a lot but I’m just glad there are enough good horror films to have that kind of problem! Since we’re talking about things we enjoy, what do you like to do for fun?
Jeremy: I like playing video games, exploring cafes around the city, reading, and going to see concerts, musicals or other local theater stuff
Eden: Wow we seem to have a lot in common, I think we’ll get along great haha!
Jeremy: Haha yea I think so too :) I’ll be honest I think you’re very pretty and you seem very cool, could I take you out to dinner? Perhaps tomorrow at Sushi Taku?
Eden: That sounds lovely, plus that actually happens to be one of my favorite restaurants! It’s a date :)
